You can find me on GitHub: **github.com/davinchick**, on Instagram: **@fimei_anastasiya** or on Telegram: **DaVinci Malevich**.

A few years ago I took the computer course at the University of Food Industry (in Mogilev). There I learned how to write *code* and create a simple *website page*. After working for several years in the field of catering, I realized that Iâ€™d better do programming :3
So, I started my self-education stage.
  Now I have skills in:
   - HTML;
   - CSS;
   - JS (at the beginning);
   - working in Sublime, IntelliJIdea, Notepad++, PhotoShop;
   - using framework Bootstrap;  
     Also I'm good at Usability, Adaptability, cross browser adaptability, and know the basics of UI & UX design.
  
     And more I can add, that I gain a lot of *skills* during my previous works, such as:
     - teamwork
     - quickly work
     - stress resistance!
     - responsibility
     - diligence
     - reliability 
     - quick learning
     - and desire to create something new (my eager to art and paint are also causes of)
